### Hi there 👋🏾, Welcome to Meyabase. 

Our goal is to revamp Namibia's digital ecosystem.

For several reasons, most of our repositories are private at the moment. You can always send me an email, axel@meyabase.com or open an issue for collaboration, etc. 😁🤞🏾

Explore [Osheng](https://github.com/meyabase/osheng), the Oshiwambo - English Digital Language Resource

All contributors are welcome

The Osheng project aims to develop an Oshiwambo, Oshikwanyama and English corpus for contextual analysis and translational purposes. Our main focus is Oshindonga and Oshikwanyama as primary languages both mapped to English as a secondary language.

Our current data is sourced from:

1. Dictionaries
    - This involves extracting text from open-source Oshiwambo <-> English Translation dictionaries.

1. Translated Bibles
    - Data collection and cleaning

1. Online articles
    - This includes online blogs, online newspaper entries and other online resources by numerous organizations. In this category, some resources have bi-lingual textual data, while others only have one language, either Oshindonga or Oshikwanyama.
